<h2 id='project-overview'>üì¶ Project Overview</h2>

Eminence Wallet is a cutting-edge, non-custodial crypto wallet designed to empower users with full control over their digital assets. Our platform provides a seamless and secure way to buy, sell, transfer, and swap various cryptocurrencies and coins, all while prioritizing user security and ease of use.. It leverages technologies like Next.js React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS to provide a user-friendly and feature-rich experience for users.

<br>

<h2 id='architecture'>üî® Architecture</h2>

Eminence Wallet follows a client-server architecture. The frontend is built using Next.js(App Router), React and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and interactive user interface. The backend is developed with Node.js and Express.js, which handles API requests and interacts with the MongoDB database.

For more detailed Architecture to the project, refer to the [Architecture Guide](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

    ```

    - Eminence Backend

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/RuntimeTerror-Labs/eminence-backend
    ```

- Navigate into the project's directory & Install the dependencies in both Repos.

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

- Setup **Environment Variable**:

  - Create a .env file in both folder front-end and back-end of the project and set the necessary environment variables. Refer to the [Environment Variable](ENVIRONMENT.md) for the required environment variables.
